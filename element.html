								<h3>Information Technology</h3>
								<p>
       Since approximately the age of 14, driven by curiosity, I started to explore the vast amount of
       creative possibilities that programming languages and software development toolkits offer. Until today I have 
        not lost any of the excitement about them.
       I gained experience in different programming and scripting languages including Java, C, C++, Vala, PHP, JavaScript, 
       Python and Bash. I have developed applications and user interfaces for both desktop and mobile operating systems (Android)
        as well as worked on web projects based on Drupal, GetSimple CMS and Jekyll. Moreover I experimented with microcontroller
       programming in C.
      </p>

      <p>
       In consequence of my affinity for software development I started to study computer science. 
       Completing a BSc programme at the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences I have learned a lot 
        of fascinating things and got in touch with interesting people.
      </p>


       <p>
       During my BSc thesis at Damiler AG's Image Understanding Group 
    (computer vision for autonomous driving and driver assistance) I worked with machine learning techniques
   including neural networks. This was a very fascinating and enjoyable time both personally and technically speaking. 
    Ever since that period I have been excited about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, which is why I chose 
    to pursue a MSc programme with focus on AI at the University of St Andrews (Scotland).

								<h4> Arts </h4>
								 <p>
       Besides computers I am interested in different sorts of arts as both consumer and creator of such. 
I am especially excited about music because it provides ways of expressing one's thoughts and feelings on a level that
 is hard to reach by plain words. I compose own songs, play the guitar and sing. I have not yet recorded or published any
 of my musical works, but a website for my project is in progress right now and I will surely write a blog post as soon as I 
have something to present.
       </p> 

      <p>Another thing that must not be left aside when talking about contemporary arts is the art of video games. 
Not all video games are designed with the sole purpose of action and stupid entertainment in mind (though that can be fun too). 
A lot of recent games  (especially "Indie Games") have very deep storytelling combined with lovely handcrafted graphics and 
revolutionary game concepts. One huge plus of video games is their interactive nature, which lets the player immerse into the 
artwork.

							<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
        The topics mentioned above are to be considered an excerpt of my interests and activities.
 If you are interested in any of these you may want to keep an eye on my blog as I am probably going to write about that 
in the future.
